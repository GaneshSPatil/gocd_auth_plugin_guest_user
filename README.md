# GoCD Auth Plugin - Guest User

Allows users to login as a guest to a [GoCD](https://www.go.cd) server.

# Status

* This is a work in progress.

# Installation

Install by building it and placing it in the plugins/external directory and restarting the server. If installed
properly, you should be able to see a big (ugly) purple button during login, which allows you to login as a guest
user.
